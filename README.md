 Hospitality Analysis
This project is a data-driven analysis of the hospitality industry using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It explores occupancy rates, revenue trends, guest satisfaction scores, and other KPIs to help hotels make better, data-backed decisions.

 Features
 Data Cleaning & Processing with Pandas for structured, high-quality datasets

 Fast Numeric Computations using NumPy for efficient feature engineering

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover key trends and correlations

 Visualizations powered by Matplotlib & Seaborn for intuitive insight sharing

 Actionable Recommendations to improve hotel operations and guest experiences

 Well-documented and fully reproducible notebooks and scripts
